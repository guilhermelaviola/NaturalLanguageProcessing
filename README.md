# NaturalLanguageProcessing
My school homework from **#DescomplicaDigital** on Natural Language Processing, which is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language (text and speech), bridging the gap between human communication and computer understanding by processing unstructured language data into structured formats for useful tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and voice assistants.
